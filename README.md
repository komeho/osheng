# Osheng | Oshiwambo - English Translation
NB: Much of the work is in localhost and not here. Email me at axel@stoiclab.com
This project aims to develop an Oshiwambo-English language dataset and translation model.

#### Current stage
- Data collection and cleaning
  - This involves extracting text from open source Oshiwambo <-> English Translation dictionary, online blog entries, online newspaper entries etc.
  - Then format the text into a .txt file, where for each row: "Onde mu adha megumbo." then a translated sentence in english is entered "I found him in the house.". Please check the file [osheng.txt](https://github.com/komeho/osheng/blob/master/osheng.txt) for reference.
  - Word, phrase and complete sentence (defined by full stop) qualify.

- Translating model
  - All this will be done after a satisfying dataset has been accomplished
  - At this point I'm just doing progressive research in Natural Language Processing
